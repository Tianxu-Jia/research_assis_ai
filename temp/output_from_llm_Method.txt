% Description of the approach taken to compare different adaptive learning rate schedules for diffusion models
In this section, we describe the approach taken to compare different adaptive learning rate schedules for diffusion models. Our methodology builds on the general formalism introduced in the Problem Setting and the concepts/foundations introduced in the Background.

% Explanation of the datasets used for training and evaluation
We use four distinct datasets for training and evaluation: 'circle', 'dino', 'line', and 'moons'. These datasets represent different types of data distributions, allowing us to assess the performance of the learning rate schedules across various scenarios.

% Description of the diffusion model architecture
The diffusion model architecture remains fixed across all experiments. We use a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) \citep{ddpm}, which iteratively denoises the data to generate high-quality samples. The model architecture includes a sinusoidal embedding layer, residual blocks, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) denoiser.

% Explanation of the adaptive learning rate schedules compared
We systematically compare several popular adaptive learning rate schedules, including Cosine Annealing with Warm Restarts \citep{lu2024aiscientist}, One Cycle Learning Rate, Cyclical Learning Rate, Exponential Learning Rate Decay, and Cosine Annealing Learning Rate. Each schedule is implemented according to its respective literature, ensuring a fair comparison.

% Description of the training process and evaluation metrics
The training process involves optimizing the model using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with the specified learning rate schedule. The objective function to be minimized is the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted noise and the actual noise added to the data. We evaluate the performance of each schedule based on metrics such as training loss, inference time, and the quality of generated samples, measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.

% Explanation of the experimental setup and data preprocessing
The experimental setup includes training the model on each dataset using the specified learning rate schedules. Data preprocessing involves normalizing the input data to ensure consistency across experiments. The training process is conducted for a fixed number of steps, and the model's performance is evaluated at regular intervals.

% Summary of the methodology and its relevance to the research question
In summary, our methodology involves systematically comparing different adaptive learning rate schedules for diffusion models across various datasets. By evaluating the performance based on key metrics, we aim to identify the best-performing schedules for different scenarios, providing insights into their effectiveness and applicability.
