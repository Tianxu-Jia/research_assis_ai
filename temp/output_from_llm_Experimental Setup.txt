\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}
% Description of the dataset used for training and evaluation
We use four distinct datasets for training and evaluation: 'circle', 'dino', 'line', and 'moons'. These datasets represent different types of data distributions, allowing us to assess the performance of the learning rate schedules across various scenarios. The datasets are generated synthetically to ensure a controlled environment for our experiments.

% Description of the evaluation metrics
To evaluate the performance of the diffusion models with different learning rate schedules, we use several key metrics: training loss, inference time, and the quality of generated samples measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's convergence, computational efficiency, and generative capability.

% Description of important hyperparameters
The important hyperparameters for our experiments include the number of training steps, batch size, and the specific parameters for each learning rate schedule. For instance, the Cosine Annealing with Warm Restarts schedule has parameters such as \( T_0 \) (initial cycle length) and \( T_{mult} \) (cycle length multiplier). The One Cycle Learning Rate schedule involves setting the maximum and minimum learning rates, and the number of cycles. The Exponential Learning Rate Decay schedule requires specifying the decay factor. These hyperparameters are tuned to ensure fair comparison across different schedules.

% Description of implementation details
The diffusion models are implemented using PyTorch, and the training process is conducted on a standard GPU setup. We use the AdamW optimizer for training, which is a variant of the Adam optimizer with weight decay regularization. The models are trained for a fixed number of steps, and the learning rate schedules are applied dynamically during training. The training loss is monitored at regular intervals, and the models are evaluated on the test set after each training epoch. The inference time is measured by generating a fixed number of samples from the trained models.

% Summary of the experimental setup
In summary, our experimental setup involves training diffusion models on four distinct datasets using five different adaptive learning rate schedules. We evaluate the performance using key metrics and ensure fair comparison by tuning the hyperparameters. The implementation details are standardized to ensure reproducibility and consistency across experiments.
