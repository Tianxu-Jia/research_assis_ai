% Brief recap of the entire paper
\subsection{Summary}
In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive empirical analysis to evaluate the impact of different adaptive learning rate schedules on the performance of diffusion models. We systematically compared several popular schedules, including Cosine Annealing with Warm Restarts \citep{lu2024aiscientist}, One Cycle Learning Rate, Cyclical Learning Rate, Exponential Learning Rate Decay, and Cosine Annealing Learning Rate. Our experiments were conducted across four distinct datasets: 'circle', 'dino', 'line', and 'moons'. The results indicate that the Exponential Learning Rate Decay schedule generally performs well across datasets, particularly for the 'circle' and 'dino' datasets, achieving the lowest KL divergence. The Cosine Annealing Learning Rate schedule also shows competitive performance, providing a good balance across different datasets.

% Potential future work as academic offspring
\subsection{Future Work}
Future research could explore the integration of these adaptive learning rate schedules with other optimization techniques, such as gradient clipping or weight decay, to further enhance model performance. Additionally, investigating the impact of these schedules on other types of generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) \citep{vae} and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) \citep{gan}, could provide a broader understanding of their applicability. Furthermore, extending the analysis to real-world datasets and more complex model architectures could yield valuable insights into the practical utility of these schedules.
