*Starting Experiments*
Thank you for providing the experiment details and baseline results. I'll plan the experiments to optimize embedding dimensions in low-dimensional diffusion models. Here's the list of  
experiments I propose:                                                                                                                                                                   

 1 Run 1: Embedding dimension 32                                                                                                                                                         
 2 Run 2: Embedding dimension 64                                                                                                                                                         
 3 Run 3: Embedding dimension 256                                                                                                                                                        
 4 Run 4: Embedding dimension 512                                                                                                                                                        

Note that we already have results for embedding dimension 128 from the baseline run, so we don't need to repeat that.                                                                    

Let's start by modifying the MLPDenoiser class to accept embedding_dim as a parameter for both time and input embeddings. We'll also update the main script to use different embedding   
dimensions for each run.                                                                                                                                                                 

Here are the changes for Run 1 (embedding dimension 32):

These changes will set up the experiment for Run 1 with an embedding dimension of 32. After running this experiment, we can proceed with the subsequent runs by updating the             
--embedding_dim argument and the labels dictionary in plot.py.

Thank you for running the flake8 checks. It appears that there are no errors reported for either plot.py or experiment.py. The warnings about frozen modules are related to the debugger 
and don't indicate any issues with the code itself.                                                                                                                                      

Since there are no errors to fix, we can proceed with the next step in our experiment plan. Let's update the experiment.py file for Run 2, which will use an embedding dimension of 64.

These changes will set up the experiment for Run 2 with an embedding dimension of 64. After running this experiment, we can proceed with the subsequent runs by updating the             
--embedding_dim argument and the labels dictionary in plot.py.

Thank you for running the flake8 checks. It appears that there are no errors reported for either plot.py or experiment.py. The warnings about frozen modules are related to the debugger 
and don't indicate any issues with the code itself.                                                                                                                                      

Since there are no errors to fix, we can proceed with the next step in our experiment plan. Let's update the experiment.py file for Run 3, which will use an embedding dimension of 256.

These changes will set up the experiment for Run 3 with an embedding dimension of 256. After running this experiment, we can proceed with the final run by updating the --embedding_dim  
argument and the labels dictionary in plot.py again.

Thank you for running the flake8 checks. It appears that there are no errors reported for either plot.py or experiment.py. The warnings about frozen modules are related to the debugger 
and don't indicate any issues with the code itself.                                                                                                                                      

Since there are no errors to fix, we can proceed with the next step in our experiment plan. Let's update the experiment.py file for Run 4, which will use an embedding dimension of 512.

Thank you for running the flake8 checks. It appears that there are no errors reported for either `plot.py` or `experiment.py`. The warnings about frozen modules are related to the debugger and don't indicate any issues with the code itself.

Since there are no errors to fix, we can proceed with the next step in our experiment plan. Let's update the `experiment.py` file for Run 4, which will use an embedding dimension of 512.

experiment.py

    parser.add_argument("--embedding_dim", type=int, default=512)

Now, let's update the `plot.py` file to include the new run in the legend:

These changes will set up the experiment for Run 4 with an embedding dimension of 512. This completes our series of experiments with different embedding dimensions (32, 64, 128 (baseline), 256, and 512).
