#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Optimizing Embedding Dimensions in Low-Dimensional Diffusion Models.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: 1. Modify MLPDenoiser to accept embedding_dim as a parameter for both time and input embeddings. 2. Categorize datasets by complexity (e.g., number of modes: circle=1, line=1, moons=2, dino=multiple). 3. Train models with various embedding dimensions (32, 64, 128, 256, 512) on each dataset. 4. Compare performance using final KL divergence, steps to reach KL threshold, visual sample quality, and training time. 5. Analyze the relationship between dataset complexity and optimal embedding dimension. 6. Investigate potential overfitting and diminishing returns with very high embedding dimensions..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'circle': {'training_time': 22.78913640975952, 'eval_loss': 0.4352689213155176, 'inference_time': 0.16325092315673828, 'kl_divergence': 0.3390841615593227}, 'dino': {'training_time': 21.349066257476807, 'eval_loss': 0.6604227140126631, 'inference_time': 0.15765833854675293, 'kl_divergence': 1.0292828033411612}, 'line': {'training_time': 20.768935203552246, 'eval_loss': 0.8046935080262401, 'inference_time': 0.15740132331848145, 'kl_divergence': 0.1572009839576215}, 'moons': {'training_time': 20.56239104270935, 'eval_loss': 0.614176513593825, 'inference_time': 0.12911629676818848, 'kl_divergence': 0.09562104554894295}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

Thank you for providing the experiment details and baseline results. I'll plan the experiments to optimize embedding dimensions in low-dimensional diffusion models. Here's the list of experiments I propose:

1. Run 1: Embedding dimension 32
2. Run 2: Embedding dimension 64
3. Run 3: Embedding dimension 256
4. Run 4: Embedding dimension 512

Note that we already have results for embedding dimension 128 from the baseline run, so we don't need to repeat that.

Let's start by modifying the `MLPDenoiser` class to accept `embedding_dim` as a parameter for both time and input embeddings. We'll also update the main script to use different embedding dimensions for each run.

Here are the changes for Run 1 (embedding dimension 32):

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class MLPDenoiser(nn.Module):
    def __init__(
            self,
            embedding_dim: int = 128,
            hidden_dim: int = 256,
            hidden_layers: int = 3,
    ):
        super().__init__()
        self.time_mlp = SinusoidalEmbedding(embedding_dim)
        # sinusoidal embeddings help capture high-frequency patterns for low-dim data
        self.input_mlp1 = SinusoidalEmbedding(embedding_dim, scale=25.0)
        self.input_mlp2 = SinusoidalEmbedding(embedding_dim, scale=25.0)

        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(embedding_dim * 3, hidden_dim),
            *[ResidualBlock(hidden_dim) for _ in range(hidden_layers)],
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 2),
        )
=======
class MLPDenoiser(nn.Module):
    def __init__(
            self,
            embedding_dim: int = 128,
            hidden_dim: int = 256,
            hidden_layers: int = 3,
    ):
        super().__init__()
        self.time_mlp = SinusoidalEmbedding(embedding_dim)
        # sinusoidal embeddings help capture high-frequency patterns for low-dim data
        self.input_mlp1 = SinusoidalEmbedding(embedding_dim, scale=25.0)
        self.input_mlp2 = SinusoidalEmbedding(embedding_dim, scale=25.0)

        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(embedding_dim * 3, hidden_dim),
            *[ResidualBlock(hidden_dim) for _ in range(hidden_layers)],
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 2),
        )
        self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    parser.add_argument("--embedding_dim", type=int, default=128)
=======
    parser.add_argument("--embedding_dim", type=int, default=32)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's update the `plot.py` file to include the embedding dimension in the legend:

plot.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Keep the names short, as these will be in the legend.
labels = {
    "run_0": "Baseline",
}
=======
# Keep the names short, as these will be in the legend.
labels = {
    "run_0": "Baseline (128)",
    "run_1": "Emb dim 32",
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will set up the experiment for Run 1 with an embedding dimension of 32. After running this experiment, we can proceed with the subsequent runs by updating the `--embedding_dim` argument and the `labels` dictionary in `plot.py`.

Thank you for running the flake8 checks. It appears that there are no errors reported for either `plot.py` or `experiment.py`. The warnings about frozen modules are related to the debugger and don't indicate any issues with the code itself.

Since there are no errors to fix, we can proceed with the next step in our experiment plan. Let's update the `experiment.py` file for Run 2, which will use an embedding dimension of 64.

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    parser.add_argument("--embedding_dim", type=int, default=32)
=======
    parser.add_argument("--embedding_dim", type=int, default=64)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's update the `plot.py` file to include the new run in the legend:

plot.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Keep the names short, as these will be in the legend.
labels = {
    "run_0": "Baseline (128)",
    "run_1": "Emb dim 32",
}

# Keep the names short, as these will be in the legend.
labels = {
    "run_0": "Baseline (128)",
    "run_1": "Emb dim 32",
    "run_2": "Emb dim 64",
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will set up the experiment for Run 2 with an embedding dimension of 64. After running this experiment, we can proceed with the subsequent runs by updating the `--embedding_dim` argument and the `labels` dictionary in `plot.py`.

Thank you for running the flake8 checks. It appears that there are no errors reported for either `plot.py` or `experiment.py`. The warnings about frozen modules are related to the debugger and don't indicate any issues with the code itself.

Since there are no errors to fix, we can proceed with the next step in our experiment plan. Let's update the `experiment.py` file for Run 3, which will use an embedding dimension of 256.

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    parser.add_argument("--embedding_dim", type=int, default=64)
=======
    parser.add_argument("--embedding_dim", type=int, default=256)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's update the `plot.py` file to include the new run in the legend:

plot.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Keep the names short, as these will be in the legend.
labels = {
    "run_0": "Baseline (128)",
    "run_1": "Emb dim 32",

    "run_1": "Emb dim 32",
    "run_2": "Emb dim 64",
    "run_3": "Emb dim 256",
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will set up the experiment for Run 3 with an embedding dimension of 256. After running this experiment, we can proceed with the final run by updating the `--embedding_dim` argument and the `labels` dictionary in `plot.py` again.

Thank you for running the flake8 checks. It appears that there are no errors reported for either `plot.py` or `experiment.py`. The warnings about frozen modules are related to the debugger and don't indicate any issues with the code itself.

Since there are no errors to fix, we can proceed with the next step in our experiment plan. Let's update the `experiment.py` file for Run 4, which will use an embedding dimension of 512.

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    parser.add_argument("--embedding_dim", type=int, default=256)
=======
    parser.add_argument("--embedding_dim", type=int, default=512)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's update the `plot.py` file to include the new run in the legend:

plot.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Keep the names short, as these will be in the legend.
labels = {
    "run_0": "Baseline (128)",
    "run_1": "Emb dim 32",
    "run_2": "Emb dim 64",
    "run_3": "Emb dim 256",
}
=======
# Keep the names short, as these will be in the legend.
labels = {
    "run_0": "Baseline (128)",
    "run_1": "Emb dim 32",
    "run_2": "Emb dim 64",
    "run_3": "Emb dim 256",
    "run_4": "Emb dim 512",
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will set up the experiment for Run 4 with an embedding dimension of 512. This completes our series of experiments with different embedding dimensions (32, 64, 128 (baseline), 256, and 512).
