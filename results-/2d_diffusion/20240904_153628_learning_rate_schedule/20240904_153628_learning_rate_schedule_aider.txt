#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules: Comparing different learning rate schedules for diffusion models..  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: In this experiment, we compare the performance of different learning rate schedules on diffusion model performance. We use the final estimated KL as the evaluation metric..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'circle': {'training_time': 22.78913640975952, 'eval_loss': 0.4352689213155176, 'inference_time': 0.16325092315673828, 'kl_divergence': 0.3390841615593227}, 'dino': {'training_time': 21.349066257476807, 'eval_loss': 0.6604227140126631, 'inference_time': 0.15765833854675293, 'kl_divergence': 1.0292828033411612}, 'line': {'training_time': 20.768935203552246, 'eval_loss': 0.8046935080262401, 'inference_time': 0.15740132331848145, 'kl_divergence': 0.1572009839576215}, 'moons': {'training_time': 20.56239104270935, 'eval_loss': 0.614176513593825, 'inference_time': 0.12911629676818848, 'kl_divergence': 0.09562104554894295}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

Thank you for providing the context and instructions. I understand that we're comparing different learning rate schedules for diffusion models, using the final estimated KL as the evaluation metric. We have up to 5 runs to complete the experiments, and we already have the baseline results.

Let's plan the experiments to compare different learning rate schedules:

1. Run 1: Linear learning rate decay
2. Run 2: Cosine annealing with warm restarts
3. Run 3: Step learning rate decay
4. Run 4: Exponential learning rate decay

We'll implement these four different learning rate schedules and compare their performance against the baseline.

Let's start with Run 1: Linear learning rate decay.

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import CosineAnnealingLR
=======
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import LinearLR
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        scheduler = CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, T_max=config.num_train_steps)
=======
        scheduler = LinearLR(optimizer, start_factor=1.0, end_factor=0.1, total_iters=config.num_train_steps)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes replace the CosineAnnealingLR scheduler with a LinearLR scheduler, which will linearly decay the learning rate from the initial value to 10% of the initial value over the course of training.

Now, let's update the notes.txt file to include information about this run:

Now you can run the experiment using the command:

After you've run this experiment and collected the results, we can proceed with implementing the next learning rate schedule.

Thank you for providing the error information. However, it seems that there were no specific errors reported by the flake8 linter for the `experiment.py` file. The message about frozen modules is a debugger warning and not related to the code quality or syntax errors.

Since there are no actual errors to fix in the `experiment.py` file, I'll proceed with the next step in our experiment plan, which is to implement the Cosine annealing with warm restarts learning rate schedule for Run 2.

Let's update the `experiment.py` file to use the CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts scheduler:

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import LinearLR
=======
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts
>>>>>>> REPLACE

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        scheduler = LinearLR(optimizer, start_factor=1.0, end_factor=0.1, total_iters=config.num_train_steps)
=======
        scheduler = CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts(optimizer, T_0=1000, T_mult=2)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's update the `notes.txt` file to include information about this new run:

Now you can run the experiment using the command:

Thank you for providing the flake8 output. It appears that there are no actual errors reported by flake8 for the `experiment.py` file. The message about frozen modules is a debugger warning and not related to code quality or syntax errors.

Since there are no errors to fix in the `experiment.py` file, no changes are necessary. The code is already correctly implemented with the Cosine Annealing with Warm Restarts learning rate schedule for Run 2.

If you want to proceed with the next step in your experiment plan or if you have any other specific changes you'd like to make, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist you.
